### About:         
&emsp;ruri is pronounced as /lʊlɪ/, or you can call it `瑠璃`.       
&emsp;ruri runs a linux container with unshare namespaces and dropped capabilities. It is designed to provide better security for Linux containers on devices that do not support docker.       
&emsp;It's like `chroot` and `unshare`, but it is more secure.       
&emsp;It is designed to be a simple and lightweight container implementation, but you are still free to define all the configurations of the container.          
&emsp;The default capability set is the same as the docker container, which can be elevated with the `-p` option, reduced by `-d`, or you can use `--keep` and `--drop` to set by yourself.      
### Quick start:      
```
git clone https://github.com/Moe-hacker/ruri
cd ruri
sudo make install
```
#### make options:
```text
  make all         :compile
  make install     :install ruri to $PREFIX
  make static      :static compile
  make clean       :clean
Only for testing:
  make dev         :compile without optimizations, enable gdb debug information and extra logs.
  make asan        :enable ASAN
  make check       :run clang-tidy
  make strictcheck :run clang-tidy for more checks
  make format      :format code
```
#### Dependent libraries:
For dynamic compilation:         
- libcap       
- libpthread 
     
For static compilation:         
- libcap-static
- libc-static         
### Usage:    
```text
ruri [Other options] [<Args> <container directory> <init command>]
Other options:
  -v                    :Show version info
  -h                    :Show helps
  -D                    :Run rurid
  -K                    :Kill rurid
  -t                    :Check if rurid is running
  -l                    :List all running unshare containers
  -U [container_dir]    :Umount&kill a container
Args for running a container:
  -u                    :Enable unshare feature
  -d                    :Drop more capabilities for better security
  -p                    :Run privileged container
 --keep [cap]           :Keep the specified cap
 --drop [cap]           :Drop the specified cap
  -e [env] [value]      :Set env to its value
  -m [dir] [mountpoint] :Mount dir to mountpoint
  -w                    :Disable warnings
```
&emsp;This program should be run with root privileges.        
&emsp;Please unset $LD_PRELOAD before running this program.              
### About rurid:         
&emsp;Rurid is the daemon of ruri. It can store the info of unshare containers and ensure that the same containers run in the same namespaces. It's not a necessary process and pure chroot containers will not communicate with the daemon.
